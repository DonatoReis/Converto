## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security vulnerability in MeuAppTop, **please do not create a public GitHub issue**. Instead, report it privately and securely by emailing:

**security@meuapptop.com**

Include as much detail as possible to help us resolve the issue quickly. We appreciate your help in keeping MeuAppTop and its users safe!

## Vulnerability Handling Process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.
- The team will investigate the vulnerability and determine the impact and resolution plan.
- A fix will be developed and, if necessary, released as a security update.
- We may publicly credit your responsible disclosure when the fix is released (if desired).
- Please do **not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been deployed and you've been notified.

Thank you for helping us improve security!
